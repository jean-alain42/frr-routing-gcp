# frr-routing-gcp
These routing labs are based on Containerlab is a new open-source network emulator that quickly builds network test environments in a devops-style workflow. 
It provides a command-line-interface for orchestrating and managing container-based networking labs and supports containerized router images available
from the major networking vendors.

These labs will demonstrate how Containerlab works with the FRR open-source router. There are 2 main labs one to test OSPF dynamic routing protocols with 
three routers and another one with BGP peerings between two AS (AS 100 and AS 200), to understand how prefix are progated with BGP protocols between AS, 
also internal BGP is shown.
